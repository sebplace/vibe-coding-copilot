<div class="step-badge">Step 1 \u2014 Describe the skeleton</div>
<p>Open Copilot Chat and describe the smallest possible version of your idea. Be specific about what's on the page.</p>
<div class="chat-mockup">
  <div class="chat-head">Copilot Chat</div>
  <div class="chat-body">
    <div class="chat-bubble-user">Build a simple webpage called "Quick Poll" with a question and four buttons as answer options.</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble-ai">Here's a starting point:
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Quick Poll&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;What would help you most this term?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Worked examples&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;More exercises&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Short videos&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Live Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Save this, open it in your browser by double-clicking the file. You now have a real, if plain, webpage.</p>

<div class="step-badge">Step 2 \u2014 Ask for the logic</div>
<p>A page with buttons that do nothing isn't very useful yet. Ask Copilot to make the buttons count votes.</p>
<div class="chat-mockup">
  <div class="chat-head">Copilot Chat</div>
  <div class="chat-body">
    <div class="chat-bubble-user">When someone clicks a button, save a vote count for that option in the browser (localStorage), so it's remembered if the page reloads.</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble-ai">I added this script at the bottom of your page:
      <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  document.querySelectorAll("button").forEach((btn, i) =&gt; {
    btn.addEventListener("click", () =&gt; {
      let votes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("votes")) || [0,0,0,0];
      votes[i]++;
      localStorage.setItem("votes", JSON.stringify(votes));
      alert("Thanks for voting!");
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Test it: click a button, reload the page, click again \u2014 the count keeps growing even though you can't see it yet. That's next.</p>

<div class="step-badge">Step 3 \u2014 Show the results</div>
<p>Now ask Copilot to replace that plain <code>alert()</code> with something people can actually see.</p>
<div class="chat-mockup">
  <div class="chat-head">Copilot Chat</div>
  <div class="chat-body">
    <div class="chat-bubble-user">Instead of an alert, hide the buttons after voting and show each option as a percentage bar based on the votes so far.</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble-ai">Good idea \u2014 that's much clearer for people voting. I replaced the alert with a small results view that calculates each option's share of the total votes and animates a bar for it. Want me to also add a "vote again" link to reset it for this demo?</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Keep going like this \u2014 one small request at a time \u2014 until the page looks and feels the way you want.</p>

<div class="step-badge">Step 4 \u2014 Try what you just built</div>
<p>This is exactly the app described above, already built and running below. Click an option and watch the results appear \u2014 this is what your students, colleagues, or team will see once you publish yours (next lesson).</p>

<div class="step-badge">Stap 1 \u2014 Beschrijf het skelet</div>
<p>Open Copilot Chat en beschrijf de kleinst mogelijke versie van je idee. Wees specifiek over wat er op de pagina moet staan.</p>
<div class="chat-mockup">
  <div class="chat-head">Copilot Chat</div>
  <div class="chat-body">
    <div class="chat-bubble-user">Bouw een eenvoudige webpagina genaamd "Snelle Peiling" met een vraag en vier knoppen als antwoordopties.</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble-ai">Hier is een startpunt:
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Snelle Peiling&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Wat zou jou dit semester het meest helpen?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Uitgewerkte voorbeelden&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Meer oefeningen&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Korte video's&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Live vraag-en-antwoord&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Bewaar dit bestand en open het in je browser door erop te dubbelklikken. Je hebt nu een echte, weliswaar eenvoudige, webpagina.</p>

<div class="step-badge">Stap 2 \u2014 Vraag om de logica</div>
<p>Een pagina met knoppen die niets doen is nog niet erg nuttig. Vraag Copilot om de knoppen stemmen te laten tellen.</p>
<div class="chat-mockup">
  <div class="chat-head">Copilot Chat</div>
  <div class="chat-body">
    <div class="chat-bubble-user">Sla, wanneer iemand op een knop klikt, een stemteller voor die optie op in de browser (localStorage), zodat die onthouden wordt als de pagina herlaadt.</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble-ai">Ik heb dit script onderaan je pagina toegevoegd:
      <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  document.querySelectorAll("button").forEach((btn, i) =&gt; {
    btn.addEventListener("click", () =&gt; {
      let votes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("votes")) || [0,0,0,0];
      votes[i]++;
      localStorage.setItem("votes", JSON.stringify(votes));
      alert("Bedankt voor je stem!");
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Test het: klik op een knop, herlaad de pagina, klik opnieuw \u2014 de teller blijft groeien, ook al zie je dat nog niet. Dat komt hierna.</p>

<div class="step-badge">Stap 3 \u2014 Toon de resultaten</div>
<p>Vraag Copilot nu om die simpele <code>alert()</code> te vervangen door iets dat mensen echt kunnen zien.</p>
<div class="chat-mockup">
  <div class="chat-head">Copilot Chat</div>
  <div class="chat-body">
    <div class="chat-bubble-user">Verberg in plaats van een alert de knoppen na het stemmen en toon elke optie als een percentagebalk op basis van de stemmen tot nu toe.</div>
    <div class="chat-bubble-ai">Goed idee, dat is veel duidelijker voor wie stemt. Ik heb de alert vervangen door een kleine resultatenweergave die het aandeel van elke optie berekent op basis van het totaal aantal stemmen en er een balk voor animeert. Wil je ook een "opnieuw stemmen"-link zodat je deze demo kunt resetten?</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Ga zo door \u2014 \u00e9\u00e9n kleine vraag tegelijk \u2014 tot de pagina er precies zo uitziet en aanvoelt als jij wilt.</p>

<div class="step-badge">Stap 4 \u2014 Probeer wat je net gebouwd hebt</div>
<p>Dit is precies de hierboven beschreven app, al gebouwd en hieronder live. Klik op een optie en bekijk hoe de resultaten verschijnen: dit is wat je studenten, collega's of team zullen zien zodra jouw versie gepubliceerd is (volgende les).</p>
